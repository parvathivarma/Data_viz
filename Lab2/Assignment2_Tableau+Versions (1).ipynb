We observe that, the security breach is becoming severe over the year and personal data such as SSN and health records are no longer safe on the internet. 2017, did have anomalies but refering to the table, we see that there are multiple instances in they year 2017. We can also see that the security measures on internet are no longer sufficient and needs to be changed. Data leak was not even significant till 2016. Now, data leak is very prominent. \n",
